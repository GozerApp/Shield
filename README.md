## Getting Started

Shield is a Swift package (comprised of many distinct modules) and delivered using the Swift Package Manager.

To use Shield in your project, add the following dependency to its `package.swift`:

```swift
  dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/outfoxx/Shield", from: "3.0.0")
  ],
```

## Documentation

Shield has documentation describing the modules and some basic reference documentation.

#### Note
The documentation is currently lacking due to issues with Swift DocC surrounding multi-module packages and extension
methods. They will be remedied soon with an upcoming releases of Swift.
